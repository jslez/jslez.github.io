# Overall approach / pseudo code

* Pull the top articles from a list of hard-coded sources
* Loop through each article
* For each article, display it in the feed if its topic matches the hardcoded topic chosen (later: allow user to change this)


… or, you select an article and it displays topic and sentiment data.
… or, it groups the articles by topic
