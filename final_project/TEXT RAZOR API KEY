CALLING THE API

The TextRazor API identifies each of your requests by your unique API Key, which you can find in the console.

All endpoints expect the API Key to be passed as an HTTP header - "X-TextRazor-Key: YOUR_API_KEY".

When calling the public TextRazor API you should always use the secure HTTPS endpoint to protect your credentials.

To enable compression of the TextRazor response JSON, add the Accept-encoding: 'gzip' header to your request. This can significantly reduce the size of TextRazor responses, and is recommended for most requests if possible.
